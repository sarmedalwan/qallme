# QallMe
QallMe is an app which allows people to share contact details instantaneously by simply touching their smartphones together, and uses NFC functionality to achieve this.  
This breaks down the social roadblock typically inherent in sharing contact details in person, and can facilitate more covid-safe sharing, minimising having to stand over each other's shoulders or talk at each other to share details.
